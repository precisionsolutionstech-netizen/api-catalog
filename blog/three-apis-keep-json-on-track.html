                <p class="meta">Why schema validation, diff checking, and consistency analysis belong in your pipeline.</p>
            </header>

            <p>Your API returns JSON. So does the other team’s. So does the vendor you integrated last quarter. Everyone promised the contract was stable. Then one Tuesday you get a support ticket: “The dashboard is broken.” You dig in. A field that was always a string is now sometimes a number. A nested object got flattened. An array that used to have at least one item is now empty. Nobody sent a memo. The JSON just… evolved.</p>

            <p>Sound familiar? JSON doesn’t have a version field. APIs don’t always announce breaking changes. The only way to stay on track is to <strong>validate what you expect</strong>, <strong>see what changed</strong>, and <strong>catch drift before it becomes a production incident</strong>. Three APIs do exactly that: a <strong>JSON Schema Validator</strong>, a <strong>JSON Diff Checker</strong>, and a <strong>JSON Payload Consistency Checker</strong>. Here’s why you want all three.</p>

            <h2>1. JSON Schema Validator: “Does this payload even belong here?”</h2>
            <p>You define a schema—required fields, types, allowed values. You send a payload. The validator says yes or no, and if no, it tells you exactly which path failed and why. No more “it worked in staging” only to discover that production sends an extra field that your code never considered, or a number where you assumed a string.</p>
            <p>Use it at the boundary: validate incoming requests before they touch your logic, and optionally validate responses from upstream APIs before you store or display them. When the contract drifts, the validator fails fast and gives you a clear error instead of a null reference three layers deep. Your future self will thank you. So will the person who has to debug at 2 a.m.</p>
            <p><a href="../apis/json-schema-validator.html">JSON Schema Validator API</a> — Validate JSON payloads against schema definitions. Inline schema or by reference; you get a clear valid/invalid result and a list of errors.</p>

            <h2>2. JSON Diff Checker: “What actually changed?”</h2>
            <p>Two JSON blobs. One from last week, one from today. Or one from the vendor’s docs, one from their live response. Manually comparing them is a great way to miss a change and an even better way to waste an afternoon. Yes, you could diff the pretty-printed files by hand. You could also reimplement grep in Excel. A diff checker compares them and returns a structured list of differences: added fields, removed fields, changed types, changed values.</p>
            <p>Use it when you’re upgrading an integration, reviewing a partner’s “non-breaking” release, or auditing before/after a normalization step. You see exactly what moved. No more “we think something changed in the billing payload but we’re not sure what.” You’re sure.</p>
            <p><a href="../apis/json-diff-checker.html">JSON Diff Checker API</a> — Compare two JSON objects and get a clear list of structural and value differences. Perfect for contract reviews and change audits.</p>

            <h2>3. JSON Payload Consistency Checker: “Is everyone playing the same game?”</h2>
            <p>You have a batch of payloads—same endpoint, different requests, or the same logical type from different sources. Are they actually consistent? Same fields every time? Same types? Or is your “list of users” sometimes missing <code>lastLogin</code>, sometimes sending it as a string, sometimes as a number? Inconsistency is where bugs hide. A consistency checker analyzes a set of JSON samples and reports what’s stable, what’s optional, what’s inconsistent, and what’s flat-out wrong.</p>
            <p>Use it to sanity-check a new API before you wire it in, to monitor your own responses in production, or to prove that a vendor’s “stable” API isn’t. Spoiler: it usually isn’t. Nobody ever got promoted for “assumed the payload was consistent.” You get promoted for knowing.</p>
            <p><a href="../apis/json-payload-consistency-checker.html">JSON Payload Consistency Checker API</a> — Analyze multiple JSON samples and get a report on structure consistency, missing fields, and type mismatches.</p>

            <h2>How the three work together</h2>
            <p><strong>Schema Validator</strong> answers: “Does this one payload match the contract?” Use it at the door—every request or every upstream response.</p>
            <p><strong>Diff Checker</strong> answers: “What’s different between these two?” Use it when comparing versions, before/after deploys, or vendor changelogs.</p>
            <p><strong>Consistency Checker</strong> answers: “Do all these payloads agree?” Use it when you have a set of samples and need to know if your API (or theirs) is actually stable.</p>
            <p>Together they keep you on track: validate the contract, diff the changes, and check consistency across the dataset. No surprise JSON. No surprise API changes. Just clear, machine-readable answers.</p>

            <h2>Where to put them</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CI/CD</strong> — Validate sample payloads against your schema; diff staging vs production responses; run consistency checks on fixture sets.</li>
                <li><strong>Gateway or adapter layer</strong> — Validate incoming requests (and optionally outgoing responses) before they hit your services.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> — Periodically diff a known-good response against a live one; run consistency checks on recent responses to catch drift.</li>
                <li><strong>Onboarding a new integration</strong> — Consistency-check a batch of their samples before you commit to a schema; diff their docs vs live to see what they didn’t document.</li>
            </ul>
